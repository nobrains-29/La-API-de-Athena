## Introduction :

- Our Team is Working on the “ Open Ideas “. <br>
- We Will be taking an Open Source API and through which we will be creating a web application. <br>
- We will be using minimum 2 API’s and clubbing them together to solve the problem. <br>


## Proposed Solution :

- We will be setting up the environment and enabling all the Google API’s. <br>
- Including Backend Development such as models, views and URLs. <br>
- Frontend Development works such as HTML and JavaScript are also included for the smooth user interface <br>
- Finally, we will be testing our app <br>

## Features :
- Adding Minimum 2 different API’s for calling . <br>
- PLACES API – As the User takes input, the google API’s automatically detects the address that makes the search . <br>
- DIRECTIONS API – As the user takes input for the start and final destination , the google API’s directs the location according to the search . <br>
